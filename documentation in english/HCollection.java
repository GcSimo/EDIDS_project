/**
 * The root interface in the <i>collection hierarchy</i>. A collection
 * represents a group of objects, known as its <i>elements</i>. Some
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not. Some are ordered
 * and others unordered. The SDK does not provide any <i>direct</i>
 * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
 * specific subinterfaces like {@code HSet} and {@code HList} (if you define one).
 * This interface is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
 * maximum generality is desired.
 *
 * <p><i>Bags</i> or <i>multisets</i> (unordered collections that may contain
 * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose {@code HCollection} implementation classes (which
 * typically implement {@code HCollection} indirectly through one of its
 * subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no
 * arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
 * constructor with a single argument of type {@code HCollection}, which
 * creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument. In
 * effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type.
 * There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain
 * constructors) but all of the general-purpose {@code HCollection}
 * implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.
 *
 * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
 * methods that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to
 * throw {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if this collection does not
 * support the operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not
 * required to, throw an {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the
 * invocation would have no effect on the collection. For example, invoking
 * the {@link #addAll(HCollection)} method on an unmodifiable collection may,
 * but is not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added
 * is empty.
 *
 * <p>Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * {@code NullPointerException} or {@code ClassCastException}. Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
